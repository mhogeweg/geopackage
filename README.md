# GeoPackages @ Esri

## Esri Already Supports GeoPackages

### ArcGIS for Desktop, Server, Runtime

* ESRI has already delivered Geopackage support in the ArcGIS 10.2.1 release that shipped at the end of 2013 – this was based on the 0.8.2 specification draft from the fall of 2013.  Realistically, this is probably of academic interest as the specification was not final – but it did allow us to actively evaluate and comment.
* ArcGIS 10.2.2 scheduled for delivery at the end of March 2014 provides support for the 1.0 specification that was recently adopted.
* ArcGIS 10.3 scheduled for delivery in July 2014 will add additional platforms and deployment options, and depending on the timing, pick up any issues identified in the first release of the geopackage specification (though the cutoff for identifying and resolving spec changes for such issues would probably be no later than mid-May to Memorial Day to make a July ship).
